# Alice 5 - SPIR-V fragment shader GPU core based on RISC-V

Our goal with Alice 5 was to create our own shader core and supporting hardware and software to download and display ShaderToy projects. We explored and understood to various degrees:
1. ShaderToy shaders and structures
1. Shader parsing using glslang to SPIR-V
1. Shader compilation using software written from scratch
1. RISC-V instruction set as a GPU shader core framework
